# MBFD - Multi-bearing fault dataset

## Introduction
<div align="justify">MBFD: Multi-bearing fault dataset is the first bearing fault dataset for multi-bearing fault diagnosis. The dataset was publish by MANDevices laboratory, Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST). The core team consists of BSc. Nguyen Duc Thuan (leader) and Prof. Hoang Si Hong (supervisor). We developed a motor test bench which is a bearing vibration data acquisition system. The MBFD dataset is available [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eoh2Z4IfsHi5xWlar5qeE3XTlcoVhsmq?usp=sharing)!</div>
